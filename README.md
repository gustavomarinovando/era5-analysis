# ERA5 Data Analysis
Here I'll add some of the scripts I'll be using to calculate water vapor attenuation<br />
In the file DataCleaning we'll show the process of extracting the data and interpolating the values to find the Total Column Water Vapor at a desired location. The data has to be previously downloaded from [CDS](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=form) only for the 4 surrounding points of the desired location.
